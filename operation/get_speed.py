    # The relationship between power and speed is a "chicken-and-egg" problem.
    # 1. The force of air resistance depends on your speed (specifically, speed squared).
    # 2. The speed you can hold depends on the force of air resistance.
    #
    # This creates a cubic equation (ax^3 + bx + c = 0) where 'x' is the speed.
    # Since there's no simple, direct formula to solve this, we use a numerical
    # method. This loop is a "guess and check" approach: it starts with a guess
    # for speed, sees how much power that would require, and then makes a new,
    # smarter guess. After a few loops, the guess becomes extremely accurate.
